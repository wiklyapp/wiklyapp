    <h1>Find Time: Smart schedule with ease</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Find Time?</h2>
    <p>Find Time helps you identify available time slots in your schedule for new tasks, family meetings, shared activities, or any other event that requires coordinating schedules.</p>

    <h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Select Participants</strong>
            <p>Choose the family members or individuals who need to be available for the scheduled event.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Choose Time Preference</strong>
			<p>Select "Morning" or "Afternoon" to narrow down the search.</p>
        </li>
		
		<li><strong>View Availability</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Highlighted slots:</strong> Indicate available times for all selected participants.</li>
				<li><strong>Empty slots:</strong> Indicate times when at least one participant is unavailable.</li>
				<li><strong>Grayed out slots:</strong> Indicate passed times.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Select day and time</strong>
			<p>Click on a highlighted time slot that works best for everyone.</p>
		</li>

        <li><strong>Create task</strong>
            <p>Once you've selected a time, follow the instructions to easily add a new task to your to-do list for that specific time slot.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

		<li>Scroll the dates to find time in the following weeks or months.</li>
		<li> Adjust the time preference (morning/afternoon) or change the selected participants to refine your search.</li>
	</ul>
